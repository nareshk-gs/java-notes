ENCAPSULATION:
--------------
The process of binding code and data (behaviour and properties) as a single entity is called encapsulation
Class is an example of encapsulation, as it binds five elements
Package is an example of encapsulation, as it binds group of classes


Encapsulation is achieved by bean classes (by defining private variables and public get and set methods)
